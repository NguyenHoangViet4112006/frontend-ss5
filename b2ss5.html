      Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
      singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting and the
      subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as
      Swifties. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a
      country singer with the albums Taylor Swift and Fearless. Fearless (2008)
      and its single "Love Story" found crossover success on country and pop
      radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and synth-pop on
      Red (2012) and the best-selling set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media
      scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums
      included chart-topping songs such as "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad
      Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".
